# Space Website

Welcome to the Space Website project! This repository contains the code for a visually stunning space-themed website, designed and developed using Figma and Locofy.ai.

## Project Overview

This project began with a design concept created in Figma, which was then converted into code using the Locofy.ai plugin. The result is a responsive, visually engaging website showcasing space-themed elements and content.

## Features

- **Space-themed Design:** Engaging visuals and a space-centric theme designed in Figma.
- **Responsive Layout:** Designed to look great on all devices.
- **Code Generated by Locofy.ai:** Efficiently transformed Figma designs into code using Locofy.ai.
